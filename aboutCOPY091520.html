      Originally from Los Angeles, I've considered Tucson "home" since coming to the University of Arizona as a first-year undergrad in 2000. I hold degrees in journalism (B.A. 2005) and business (M.B.A. 2010) from the UA, and consider myself immensely priveleged to have my career bring me back to campus full-time in 2013. Today, I serve hundreds of dedicated students each year as director of Arizona Student Media, the UA department that financially and operationally supports the 121-year-old Arizona Daily Wildcat student news organization, UATV-3 student television, and KAMP Student Radio. I live near campus with my wife, Lindsey (also a UA alumna and my favorite on-campus coworker!), our beagle, Mayhem (he actually sweet and well-behaved, and rarely lives up to his name), and, in my freetime, I freelance covering the Tucson Roadrunners minor league hockey team and other sports for the Arizona Daily Star and Tucson.com.
